probabilities for farkle

This project is designed to provide a working problem for practice writing code in javascript.

The game farkle is a dice game using 6 die, and there are a limited number of ways a player can score.

I am working on writing efficient functions that can calculate the probabilities of all possible scoring scenarios,
and to format those probabilities into a useful "cheat sheet" that is easy for a player to reference during the game in order to make
winning strategic decisions.
